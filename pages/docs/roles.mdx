# AI Roles

PromptX roles are not just system prompts. They are complete AI personalities with domain knowledge, personal memory, behavioral principles, and professional tools.

## What is a Role?

An AI role in PromptX is like hiring a professional expert. Each role has:

- **Personality** - Unique character traits and communication style
- **Expertise** - Deep domain knowledge and professional skills
- **Memory** - Personal experience and knowledge accumulated over time
- **Tools** - Specialized capabilities and integrations
- **Principles** - Work methods and decision-making frameworks

Think of roles as different hats your AI can wear - each one bringing a complete professional identity.

## How to Activate a Role

There are several ways to activate a role in PromptX:

### Natural Language (Recommended)

Just talk naturally - the AI will understand your intent:

```
I need help creating a custom role
```

```
Can I talk to Nuwa?
```

```
I want to integrate an API
```

### Direct Activation

Explicitly request a role:

```
Activate Nuwa
```

```
Switch to Luban
```

### Task-Based

Describe your task, and the AI may suggest appropriate roles:

```
I need to write marketing copy for our landing page
```

The AI might respond: "This sounds like a perfect task for Writer. Would you like me to activate Writer for you?"

## Role Capabilities

### Memory System Integration

Each role has its own memory network. When you work with a role:

1. **Personal Memory** - The role remembers your conversations and preferences
2. **Domain Knowledge** - Accumulated expertise in their field
3. **Project Context** - Information specific to your projects

Example:
```
User: Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
Nuwa: I'll remember your TypeScript preference for future role designs.

[Later conversation]
User: Create a developer role for me
Nuwa: I'll design a developer role with TypeScript expertise, based on your preferences.
```

### Tool Access

Roles have access to appropriate tools for their domain:

- **Writer** - Word tool, grammar checkers
- **Luban** - Tool creator, API integrators
- **All roles** - File system, basic operations

### Behavioral Consistency

Roles maintain consistent personality and methods:

- **Nuwa** always uses structured role design methodology
- **Writer** always follows ISSUE framework for gathering context
- **Sean** always applies Shield-Spear decision framework

---

## Creating Custom Roles

You can create custom roles for your specific needs using Nuwa.

### Step 1: Activate Nuwa

```
User: Activate Nuwa, I want to create a custom role
```

### Step 2: Describe Your Needs

Nuwa will ask you questions to understand:
- What domain or task?
- What personality traits?
- What knowledge is needed?
- What tools should it have?

### Step 3: Iterate and Refine

Work with Nuwa to refine the role definition until it matches your needs.

### Example: Creating a "DevOps Expert" Role

```
User: Activate Nuwa, I need a DevOps expert role

Nuwa: I'll help you create a DevOps expert role. Let me ask a few questions:

1. What specific DevOps areas should this role cover? (CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring, etc.)
2. What cloud platforms do you use? (AWS, GCP, Azure?)
3. What's the personality style - cautious and security-focused, or fast and experimental?
4. Should this role have access to specific tools or APIs?

User: Focus on Kubernetes and AWS, security-focused personality, needs access to kubectl

Nuwa: Perfect! I'll create a role with:
- Deep Kubernetes and AWS expertise
- Security-first mindset with defense-in-depth principles
- Access to kubectl and AWS CLI tools
- Cautious, methodical personality
- Best practices for infrastructure as code

Would you like me to generate the role definition?
```

## Role Configuration (DPML)

Roles are defined using DPML (Deepractice Prompt Markup Language), an XML-based markup language with Markdown content.

### Role File Structure

A complete role consists of multiple files:

```
{roleId}/
├── {roleId}.role.md          # Main role definition
├── thought/                   # Thinking patterns (optional)
│   └── *.thought.md
├── execution/                 # Behavior workflows (optional)
│   └── *.execution.md
└── knowledge/                 # Private knowledge (optional)
    └── *.knowledge.md
```

### Main Role File

The main role file uses XML tags to structure the role definition:

```xml
# Role Display Name

<role>

<personality>
Core identity and thinking patterns...

@!thought://thinking-pattern-name
@!thought://another-pattern
</personality>

<principle>
Behavioral rules and workflows...

@!execution://workflow-name
@!execution://another-workflow
</principle>

<knowledge>
@!knowledge://domain-knowledge
@!knowledge://private-info
</knowledge>

</role>
```

### Core Tags

- `<role>` - Root container for the role
- `<personality>` - Identity and thinking patterns
- `<principle>` - Behavioral rules and workflows
- `<knowledge>` - Private domain knowledge

### Resource References

Use `@!` to reference external files:

- `@!thought://name` - References `thought/name.thought.md`
- `@!execution://name` - References `execution/name.execution.md`
- `@!knowledge://name` - References `knowledge/name.knowledge.md`

### Thought Files

Thought files define cognitive patterns and use semantic sub-tags:

```xml
<thought>
  <exploration>
    ## Open-ended exploration
    Content for divergent thinking...
  </exploration>

  <reasoning>
    ## Logical reasoning
    Content for deductive thinking...
  </reasoning>

  <challenge>
    ## Critical thinking
    Content for questioning assumptions...
  </challenge>

  <plan>
    ## Strategic planning
    Content for action planning...
  </plan>
</thought>
```

**Sub-tag usage:**
- Use 1-4 sub-tags based on content type
- Not all sub-tags are required
- Organize content with Markdown inside sub-tags

### Execution Files

Execution files define behavioral workflows:

```xml
<execution>
  <process>
    ## Main workflow

    ### Step 1: ...
    ### Step 2: ...
  </process>

  <constraint>
    ## Hard constraints
    - Time limit: X minutes
    - Must satisfy: ...
  </constraint>

  <rule>
    ## Conditional rules
    - IF condition THEN action
    - ELSE alternative
  </rule>

  <guideline>
    ## Best practices
    - Guideline 1
    - Guideline 2
  </guideline>

  <criteria>
    ## Success criteria
    - ✅ Criterion 1
    - ✅ Criterion 2
  </criteria>
</execution>
```

**Sub-tag usage:**
- `<process>` is usually required
- Other sub-tags are optional
- Use only what's needed

### Knowledge Files

Knowledge files contain private domain information:

```xml
<knowledge>
## Domain-specific information

Content organized with Markdown...

### Section 1
...

### Section 2
...
</knowledge>
```

**Note:** Knowledge files don't use sub-tags - content goes directly under `<knowledge>`.

### Example: Simplified Role

```xml
# Python Mentor

<role>

<personality>
I am a patient Python mentor who teaches through examples
and encourages best practices.

Core traits:
- Patient and encouraging
- Example-driven teaching
- Focus on fundamentals

@!thought://teaching-methodology
@!thought://code-review-mindset
</personality>

<principle>
@!execution://teaching-workflow
@!execution://code-review-process
</principle>

<knowledge>
@!knowledge://python-best-practices
@!knowledge://common-pitfalls
</knowledge>

</role>
```

### File Locations

- **System roles**: Built into PromptX at `packages/resource/resources/role/`
- **User roles**: `~/.promptx/user/role/`
- **Project roles**: `<project>/.promptx/resource/role/`

### Key Principles

1. **Simple tags only** - No attributes on tags
2. **Semantic sub-tags** - Use meaningful categorization
3. **Markdown inside tags** - Rich formatting within XML structure
4. **Modular references** - Separate concerns into different files
5. **No generic knowledge** - Only put private/specific information in knowledge files

## Best Practices

### Choose the Right Role

Match the role to your task:

- **Creating roles or personas** → Nuwa
- **Integrating APIs or building tools** → Luban
- **Writing content** → Writer
- **Product decisions** → Sean
- **General tasks** → Assistant (default)

### Build Role Memory

Help roles remember important context:

```
Remember that our brand voice is friendly and approachable
```

```
Note that we use React and TypeScript for all frontend projects
```

### Switch Roles as Needed

Don't hesitate to switch roles during a conversation:

```
User: [Working with Nuwa on role design]
User: Thanks Nuwa! Now I need to integrate this with our API
User: Activate Luban
```

### Combine Role Expertise

Use multiple roles for complex projects:

1. **Sean** for strategy and prioritization
2. **Nuwa** to design supporting roles
3. **Luban** to build necessary tools
4. **Writer** to document everything

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I modify system roles?

System roles (Nuwa, Luban, Writer, Sean) cannot be modified directly, but you can create your own variants using Nuwa.

### How many roles can I have active at once?

Only one role is active at a time. Switch between roles as needed for different tasks.

### Do roles remember conversations across sessions?

Yes! Roles use the cognitive memory system to maintain long-term memory across sessions.

### Can roles access my files?

Roles have access to tools you've authorized. They won't access files without your explicit instruction.

### What happens to role memory when I delete a role?

The memory is preserved in the database. If you recreate a role with the same ID, it will retain the memory.
