# Quick Start

Get PromptX up and running in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Operating System**: macOS 10.15+, Windows 10+, or Linux
- **AI Application**: Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-enabled application
- **Internet Connection**: For downloading the application

---

## Step 1: Install PromptX

Choose one of the following installation methods:

### Option A: Desktop Application (Recommended)

Download and install the desktop application for your operating system:

- **macOS**: [Apple Silicon](https://promptx.deepractice.ai/download/latest/promptx-desktop-mac-arm64.dmg) | [Intel](https://promptx.deepractice.ai/download/latest/promptx-desktop-mac-x64.dmg)
- **Windows**: [64-bit Installer](https://promptx.deepractice.ai/download/latest/promptx-desktop-win32-x64-setup.exe)
- **Linux**: [All Formats](https://promptx.deepractice.ai/download/latest/)

The desktop app includes:
- HTTP MCP server on port 5203
- Visual resource manager
- Auto-updater
- System tray integration

Once installed, launch the PromptX desktop app. It will automatically start the MCP server.

### Option B: NPX (For Developers)

If you have Node.js (18.17.0+) installed:

```bash
npx -y @promptx/mcp-server
```

### Option C: Docker

Run PromptX in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5203:5203 -v ~/.promptx:/root/.promptx deepracticexs/promptx:latest
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Your AI Application

Add the PromptX MCP server to your AI application's configuration.

### For Claude Desktop

**Configuration File Location:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptx": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5203/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Cursor

Open Cursor settings and add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptx": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5203/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 3: Restart & Verify

1. **Restart your AI application** (Claude Desktop or Cursor)
2. **Verify the connection**: Look for PromptX in the list of available MCP servers
3. **Check the status**: The PromptX desktop app should show "Connected" status

### Troubleshooting

If PromptX doesn't appear:
- Ensure the PromptX desktop app is running
- Check that port 5203 is not being used by another application
- Verify the configuration file was saved correctly
- Check logs at `~/.promptx/logs/`

## Step 4: Try Your First Commands

Now let's test PromptX! Open your AI application and try these:

### Discover Available Resources

Ask your AI:

```
Show me what experts are available
```

or simply:

```
What can PromptX do?
```

You should see a list of:
- **System roles**: Nuwa, Luban, Writer, Sean
- **Available tools**: PDF reader, Excel, Word, filesystem
- **Memory commands**: recall, remember

### Activate Your First Role

Try activating Nuwa, the AI role creator:

```
Activate Nuwa
```

or more naturally:

```
I need help creating a custom AI role
```

Once activated, Nuwa will introduce herself and you can start working together!

### Use the Memory System

Store information:

```
Remember that I prefer using TypeScript for all projects
```

Later, recall it:

```
What are my project preferences?
```

### Explore Tools

Ask about available tools:

```
What tools can you access?
```

You'll see tools like:
- 📄 PDF Reader
- 📊 Excel Operations
- 📝 Word Documents
- 📁 File Management
